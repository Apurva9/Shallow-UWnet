# Shallow-UWnet

## Introduction
In this project we have proposed a shallow neural network architecture, Shallow-UWnet which maintains performance and has fewer parameters than the state-of-art underwater image enhancement model. We have demonstrated the generalization of our model by benchmarking its performance on combination of synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Train Model
The model can be trained using the `training.py` file.

## Test Model
The model object saved through `training.py` can be used in `test.py` for obtaining result metric.
